<h3>What</h3>

<p>Open-Footprint is a non-profit initiative to build an open-source platform that monitors the sites you regularly visit, building up a cohesive picture of the information and potential footprint you're placing on the internet.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>In the past 10 years social media has been increasingly in the focus of the media, with new platforms popping up all the time. Itâ€™s addictive and on paper very useful but like most things it has a dark side.</p>

<p>This project aims to give the user a birds-eye view of their journey across the internet super-highway, in order to help teach better internet safety.</p>

<h3>When</h3>

<p>Currently in active development, aiming for a 2019 release we're looking for help to guide and bring this project to life. If you know some JavaScript and can spare a little time why not look at our <a href="https://github.com/johnantoni/open-footprint/issues">github issue list</a> for something to work on.</p>
