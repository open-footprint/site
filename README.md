## About

An open-source platform that monitors the sites you regularly visit, building up a cohesive picture of the information and potential footprint you're placing on the internet.

## Why

In the past 10 years social media has been increasingly in the focus of the media, with new platforms popping up all the time. Itâ€™s addictive and on paper very useful but like most things it has a dark side.

This project aims to give the user a birds-eye view of their journey across the internet super-highway, in order to help teach better internet safety.
